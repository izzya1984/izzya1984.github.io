    In my opinion, sweet potato casserole deserves an actual spotlight shining bright on it during Thanksgiving dinner. How it ever made its way onto the table during the main course as a vegetable, I'm not entirely sure, but I'm not mad about it either. It's creamy and delicious and I believe marshmallows are a MUST and would honestly consider it a Thanksgiving catastrophe if the sweet potato casserole arrived without marshmallows on top. Others aren't as dramatic as me and like their sweet potato casserole without marshmallows (this recipe has a crumble topping instead that's INSANE). Here are our tips to ensure all Thanksgiving catastrophes are avoided. 
<br>
      <ol>
        <li>Use dark brown sugar.
      <p> Using dark instead of light brown sugar will provide a deeper more caramel-like flavor. It will ensure your sweet potato casserole is the one asked for year after year and will give you a more caramelized topping. 
      
          Does your brown sugar always harden in the box? A marshmallow is your friend here: Place one in the bag with the sugar, and the marshmallow will absorb any moisture instead of the sugar. (Read more tips on keeping brown sugar soft here.)
         </p>

        </li>
<li>Roast the sweet potatoes.
      <p> Instead of boiling your sweet potatoes, try roasting them. It will take a little longer but not extra work necessarily. Roasting makes them sweeter and will dry them out slightly (which is a good thing!); it'll give your casserole a thicker texture instead of a soupy one. 
        </p>

</li>
<li> Mix it up with a little sweetness.
  <p> Once you roast and mash your sweet potatoes, you mix it up with brown sugar, melted butter, eggs, and vanilla. Don't forget the saltâ€”it will help bring out the sweetness!
    </p></li>
<li>Top with pecans AND marshmallows.
  <p> Most casseroles only have one or the other. Don't even think about making this mistake. Topping with a pecan streusel and then marshmallows makes this casserole stand out above all the rest. Chopped pecans add a necessary texture to the casserole and the rest of the streusel kind of melts into the sweet potatoes. Marshmallows ensure a beautiful presentation with their golden tops and their melty sweetness is an essential element to the sweet potato casserole. 
    </p>
  </li>


      </ol>
      
      
      
      CAN YOU MAKE SWEET POTATO CASSEROLE IN ADVANCE?
      
      Yes! You can cook and mash the sweet potatoes and assemble the casserole (including the pecan topping) up to a day in advance. Keep in the refrigerator until ready to top with mini marshmallows and bake.
