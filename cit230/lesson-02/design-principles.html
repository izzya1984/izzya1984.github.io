Each of these sections will take about 33,33% of the horizontal space and the same percent of the vertical space. That's why they are called “Thirds”.
                     In the CFA Mobile site is more about photography, but the same rule still applies  </p></div>

                                A while back, during my typography class I was having some trouble with the color combinations. Best advice that I received from my instructor regarding that was “print it on black and white, if you can’t tell the difference, change your colors.”
                                In the Zappos Site mobile and desktop the contrast on the information, as well as the photography, make everything easy to read, and too easy to shop too ( ask my credit card)

                            This example comes from the Urban Decay mobile site, negative space, also known as white space, is all about leaving some breathing room, or empty space in the page ( less is more) to avoid information/element overload.
