        <h3>A mermaid walks into a bar</h3>

        I don’t often ditch church activities, but when I do, I go to a bar to play Parks and Rec trivia.

        <blockquote><q>Oh Izzy, you poetic noble land mermaid! The things you do in the name of fun.</q></blockquote>
        <img src="images/lmb.jpg" alt="Itzel at the brewery">

        <p>It started in September, this add made its way through my Facebook feed, it was about an <q>Office</q> trivia
          night, but I couldn’t get a team to play with me, so I stayed home. Fast forward 2 months, ‘twas the night of
          the 14th day of the 11th month, my awesome family ward had a ministering interview/game night planned, and I
          always get excited about all things game night. But just a few days before I saw this add. PARKS AND
          RECREATION TRIVIA NIGHT AT LITTLE MISS BREWING, THURSDAY 7:30 PM.</p>
        <p>Could this be?</p>
        <p>I love parks and rec. I breathe parks and rec, WAFFLES, FRIENDS, WORK. I had a very serious conversation in
          the mirror, I told myself that even if I couldn’t get anyone to go with me, I’d still go. Well, with my
          beautiful rainbow infused space unicorn in Utah with her parents, I’m not surprised that I couldn’t get a
          team, it was time to make a choice, do I go to church and go on with normal life? Or do I get out of my
          comfort zone and go to a bar all by my lonesome? </p>
        <p>HIGHER, FURTHER, FASTER I always say, no wait that was Carol Danvers, anyway. I summoned strength from the
          Wamapoke Indian spirits, and had some waffles for dinner, put on my big girl panties and my lil’ sebastian
          T-shirt. I headed to this bar all by myself.</p>
        <p>Did I win? No, but I got 26/30, while other teams had other minds to bounce ideas from, I had my multiple
          personalities to counsel me. And we did good. I was very impressed by this place, they had boardgames, and you
          can even take your dog, there were dog biscuits in the counter. And all puppies get photographed during their
          first visit.</p>
        <blockquote><q>I don’t drink, I’m just here for the trivia</q></blockquote>
        <p>Even after telling the bartender that I didn’t drink (there goes his tip), he was super nice to me. I am
          definitely doing trivia night at Little Miss brewing again, just waiting for a theme that catches my eye. And
          now I feel awesome for getting out of my comfort zone for a couple hours.</p>
        <p>Not sure what my bishop thought of my Instagram post though</p>
        <blockquote><q>The one thing I don’t get, is how a place that sells all these hipster ales, had no ginger Ale-
            Badum Tss</q></blockquote>
