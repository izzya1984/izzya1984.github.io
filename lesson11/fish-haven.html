    <h2>The Story of the bear Lake monster</h2>

      <p>An 1868 article in the Deseret News announced that, “The Indians have a tradition concerning a strange, 
        serpent-like creature inhabiting the waters of Bear Lake…. Now, it seems this water devil, as the Indians
         called it, has again made an appearance. A number of our white settlers declare they have seen it with
          their own eyes. This Bear Lake Monster, they now call it, is causing a great deal of excitement up here”
           and then the author—Joseph C. Rich—went on to relate several sightings of the creature in recent times.
            The article created a stir in Salt Lake City and within a month “a news staff member… quizzed many Bear
             Lake people and found hardly a person who doubted it.”</p>
             <p> LDS Church leaders took an interest in the monster and when they visited the area on preaching
                tours, took the opportunity to speak firsthand with the residents of the region. They stated that 
                they “had conversation with brother Charles C. Rich and other brethren from Bear Lake Valley,
                 respecting the monster which have been seen in the lake” and found that they declared that the
                  testimony that had been given “by so many individuals, who have seen these creatures in so many
                   places and under a variety of circumstances” that they (the locals) considered the story to be
                    “indisputable.”[7] The Deseret News continued to publish articles about the Monster—skeptically
                     at times and defensively at others—while other local newspapers turned to attack the stories
                      of a water devil. The Salt Lake Tribune even went as far as to quip that the Monster was
                       “twin brother to the devil and cousin to Brigham [Young].”
          
               </p>
               <p> Articles about the Bear Lake Monster continued to appear over the next several years,  
                 either reciting new sightings of the Bear Lake Monster as well as similar creatures in 
                 other rivers and lakes in the Utah Territory or calling the sightings into question.
                  The number of alleged appearances of lake monsters all across northern Utah caused some 
                  people to speculate that there was an underground channel connecting the Great Salt
                   Lake and other waterways to Bear Lake. Interest was high enough that at one point 
                   even LDS Church president Brigham Young decided to investigate the claims to find 
                   out whether the story was “an honest tale of a serpent, or only a fish story” and 
                   went as far as sending a large rope to Paris, Idaho to aid in capturing the monster.
                
                 </p>
                 <p>  
                    Interest eventually died down in the subject and the phenomenon faded from public memory.
                     Twenty-six years following his articles and allegations, Joseph C. Rich finally 
                     admitted that it had all been a “wonderful first class lie.”</p>
